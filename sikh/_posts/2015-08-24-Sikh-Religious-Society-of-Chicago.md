The Sikh Resource Society is located in the Midwest and offers services such as free tours for public/private schools, collages and universities as well as individual tours to those that would like to understand better their global Sikh neighbor. The Sikh Resource Society also has speakers who are willing to give a presentation on the Sikh faith.

Tours are mainly held at the Gurdwara Sahib that is located at 1280 Winnetka Street, Palatine, IL; on a campus spread over fourteen acres of land at a prime location in Chicago&#8217;s metropolitan area. The Palatine Gurdwara is the oldest Gurdwara in the Midwest, started in 1972. In a seven day a week religious program, devotees visit the Gurdwara Sahib to make prayers, listen to the Sikh religious hymns (Kirtan), and discourses on spirituality.Tours are conducted at a nearby Gurdwara, including Palatine (Sikh Religious Society of Chicago), Wheaton (Illinois Sikh Community Center), Devon (Devon Gurdwara Sahib), and other Gurdwaras (Sikh place of worship) in the region.
