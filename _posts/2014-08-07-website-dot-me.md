It gets quite hard when you've to manage multiple cPanels & WordPress logins and if you're designer/developer you might have and remembering Login credential for them sometimes become pain in the arse. 

If you are a designer or developer today, you probably juggle dozens, if not hundreds of individual cPanelÂ® and WordPress logins for yourself, your clients, your friends and family and maybe even the neighbor's dog. Like us, you've probably created your own system of text files, spreadsheets and sticky notes to manage these logins. 


## Interface

Signing up for the service is quite easy, you can sign-up using your social network or if you prefer using email address instead, you can go for that. After signing up and confirming email
you'll get access to your account where you can add all the information about you, like name , description and anything else you like, by default you're provided with some beautiful images
to set as background but if you prefer using your own, you can upload and use it as background. The box containing all your information is movable so, place it where ever you like on the display.
