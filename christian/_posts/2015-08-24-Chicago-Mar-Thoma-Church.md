The Parish in itself is a history and desire of people to be with Lord the creator and protectorâ€¦.
In the early seventies around twenty families were assembling for heartfelt worship at their own apartments or houses. The late former Metropolitan, Most Rev. Dr. Alexander Mar Thoma (Alexander Mar Theophilus Episcopa that time) on his visit to Chicago in May 1973 encouraged the small group of Mar Thomites in the Chicago land to meet for regular worship which became Chicago Mar Thoma group. With the steady influx of Malayalee immigrants, the group registered in March 1977 in the state of Illinois as not-for-profit organization. The group received assignment of pastoral services for the first time in September 1977; the Mar Thoma Synod approved the group as a congregation in May 1978. As the congregation continued to grow spiritually and in membership, the congregation was elevated to Parish status in Aug 1981. A full time Vicar was assigned in 1983 for Chicago Mar Thoma Church.

Members strong desire to have their own place for worship instead of rented buildings resulted in the formation of a Church building committee in 1983 and in January 1985 the existing land at 240 Potter Road was purchased. Most Rev. Dr. Alexander Mar Thoma Metropolitan in July 14, 1985 laid the foundation stone for a new Church. In November 1986, Rt. Rev. Thomas Mar Timotheos dedicated the new Church as Chicago Mar Thoma Church. The Church acquired another acre of land in august 1988 for Parsonage building. In the history of Chicago Mar Thoma Church, it became a mother parish when Bethel Mar Thoma Church was dedicated in Frankfort, IL. In the year 1995 Parish received another recognition, service of an Assistant Vicar and the Parish purchased a new Parsonage building. The continued growth of the parish made Parish to buy another piece of land for a second Church in Lombard, IL. In the year 2004 as per the Kalpana of Metropolitan 110 families of Chicago Mar Thoma Church became members of St Thomas Mar Thoma Church which eventually built the current structure of St. Thomas Mar Thoma Church at Lombard, IL thus making Chicago Mar Thoma Church mother parish for the second time. 

Today Chicago Mar Thoma Church is the second largest Parish in North America and Europe diocese. Praise Lord for the ways and means he guided the community.
