The Central Illinois Mosque and Islamic Center, also known as CIMIC, is a religious, not-for-profit organization affiliated with the Islamic Society of North America.

The purpose of CIMIC is to advance the cause of Islam and serve Muslims in East Central Illinois. CIMIC aims to provide coordination of local Muslim affairs, establish educational opportunities for local Muslims of all ages, foster a positive understanding of Islam in American society, and promote a spirit of brotherhood and equality and a commitment to justice.

The events organized by mosque volunteers serve the Muslim community of Central Illinois and the community of Champaign-Urbana at large. The mosque seeks to promote a nurturing educational environment, a family-friendly social environment, interfaith events with the community at large, and social activism.

Our structure includes a library, classrooms and a multi-purpose area. This space is used for Weekend Islamic School for children, Arabic school for people of all ages, and English classes for immigrants. The space is also used for tae-kwon-do classes twice a week as well as ping-pong tournaments and youth group activities. The mosque provides a place for small weddings, Eid celebrations and daily iftar meals in Ramadan.
